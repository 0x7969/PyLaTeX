PyLatex
=======

PyLatex is a Python library for creating LaTeX files. The point of this library
is being an easy, but extensible interface between Python and Latex.


### Features

The library contains some basic features I have had the need for so far.
Currently those are:

- Document generation and compilation
- Section, table and package classes
- An escape function
- Bold and italic functions

Everything else you want you can still add to the document by adding LaTeX
formatted strings.


### Future development

I will keep adding functionality I need to this library, an interface for
graphics and math will probably be added in a future version.

If you add a feature yourself, or fix a bug, please send a pull request.

You can submit issues, but it will not be my priority to fix them. My job and
education are a bit higher on the priority list.
