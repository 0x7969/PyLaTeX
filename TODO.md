### A list of ideas for future improvements

- Use class names as a default for the named container
- Create a dedicated Float class that Figure and Subfigure can inherit from
- Allow the data keyword argument of containers to be a single argument
- Use https://github.com/mbr/latex to build the pdfs since it's more robust at
    generating pdfs than the code in this repo
- Add generate_tex to BaseLaTeXClass so it can be used to create snippets in an
    easier way.
